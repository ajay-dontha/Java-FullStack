       <p>
           Cricket is a <b>bat-and-ball</b> game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a 22-yard 
          (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps.<i>The game proceeds when a player
          on the fielding team, called the bowler,<mark> "bowls" </mark>(propels) the ball from one end of the pitch towards the wicket at 
          the other end.The batting side's players score runs by striking the bowled ball with a bat and running between the wickets</i> 
          while the bowling side tries to prevent this by keeping the ball within the field and getting it to either wicket, and dismiss each 
          batter (so they are "out"). <mark> of dismissal include being bowled,</mark> when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by 
          the fielding side either catching a hit ball before it touches the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can 
          cross the crease line in front of the wicket to complete a run. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends and the 
          teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated but two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches.
